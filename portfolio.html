				<h1>Medium (Work in Progress)</h1>
				<p class="pageText" >
					Medium is a solo endeavor into Unity, Wwise, C#, and sound/music for video games. One major problem I faced the past few years is that I had a desire to work on sound for video games, but no idea where to find someone working on a game. So, I chose instead to create my own "game", or what I like to call a virtual installation, to both practice this medium and explore what artmaking in 3D space is like without needing access to a real space for building an installation. <br><br>
					As it turns out, virtual space opens up sound art way past what a simple installation does, because the virutal world isn't confined to the same rules as the physical world. <br><br>
					Tools to make this piece include Wwise, Pro Tools, and Max/MSP.

				<h1>Weird Looking Dogs</h1>
				<p class="pageText" >
					Co-directed by the amazing <a class="linkem" href="https://www.instagram.com/young_kanvas/?hl=en" target="_blank">Young Kang</a> and <a class="linkem" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06Yh0gGJspxyLEMJ61GP1g" target="_blank">Anya Butler</a>, with music by the stupendous <a class="linkem" href="https://www.royberardo.com/index.php" target="_blank">Roy Berardo</a>, Weird Looking Dogs follows the story of two friends catching up while exploring a dungeon, coming across a few adventurous monsters on their way. <br><br>With 10:22 of action-packed scenes, this project was a lot to take on as a solo sound designer, foley artist, and mixer, especially because of its lively cartoony feeling with which I have less experience. But, it has become a project which I am extremely proud of, and will go down as one of the hardest projects I completed in my collegiate years. It also holds a special place in my heart because I got to create the voice of the monsters, some of the most memorable characters in the film.

				<h1>Stead</h1>
				<p class="pageText" >
					Stead is an original found-footage film exploring topics like suburbia, family, and marriage. The sound for the film was created from scratch before any work was done on the picture, which made for a fun and unique creative project. <br><br>Stead was one of my first ventures with more experimental sound for film, and one of the first live action films I have been a part of producing. The film premiered at my Graduation Recital: <a class="linkem" href="./side/theDeepWeb/HojPoj.html">Hoj Poj</a>.<br><br>All footage used was taken from the <a class="linkem" href="https://archive.org/details/prelinger">Prelinger Archive of Home Movies</a>.

				<h1>Something Fishy</h1>
				<p class="pageText" >
					In collaboration with the incredible filmmaker <a class="linkem" href="https://www.instagram.com/christinawoowoo/" target="_blank">Christina Woo</a>, and with music from the lovely Emily Tschirhart, Something Fishy tells the story of Sara, a woman getting ready to go on a date with her new boyfriend. But Jessica, Sara's pet goldfish, notices something not quite right about him. <br><br>Something Fishy was a challenge in subtlety. There is only so much sound in an LA apartment, so creativity within the realm of noise had to be explored in other ways, like playing with reverb very intentionally, or making music convincingly diegetic. As always, working with Christina was an amazing treat. <br><br>Something Fishy was one of a handful of student films selected to be screened at the 2022 CalArts Character Animation Producers' Show.
