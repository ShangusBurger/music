				<h1>Weird Looking Dogs</h1>
				<p class="pageText" >
					Co-directed by the amazing <a class="linkem" href="https://www.instagram.com/young_kanvas/?hl=en" target="_blank">Young Kang</a> and <a class="linkem" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06Yh0gGJspxyLEMJ61GP1g" target="_blank">Anya Butler</a>, with music by the stupendous <a class="linkem" href="https://www.royberardo.com/index.php" target="_blank">Roy Berardo</a>, Weird Looking Dogs follows the story of two friends catching up while exploring a dungeon, coming across a few adventurous monsters on their way. <br><br>With 10:22 of action-packed scenes, this project was a lot to take on as a solo sound designer, foley artist, and mixer, especially because of its lively cartoony feeling with which I have less experience. But, it has become a project which I am extremely proud of, and will go down as one of the hardest projects I completed in my collegiate years. It also holds a special place in my heart because I got to create the voice of the monsters, some of the most memorable characters in the film.

				<h1>Stead</h1>
				<p class="pageText" >
					Stead is an original found-footage film exploring topics like suburbia, family, and marriage. The sound for the film was created from scratch before any work was done on the picture, which made for a fun and unique creative project. <br><br>Stead was one of my first ventures with more experimental sound for film, and one of the first live action films I have been a part of producing. The film premiered at my Graduation Recital: <a class="linkem" href="./side/theDeepWeb/HojPoj.html">Hoj Poj</a>.<br><br>All footage used was taken from the <a class="linkem" href="https://archive.org/details/prelinger">Prelinger Archive of Home Movies</a>.

				<h1>Aki</h1>
				<p class="pageText" >
					From the amazing mind of <a class="linkem" href="https://www.instagram.com/wanciandpeas/" target="_blank">Wanci Hua</a>, with music from the lovely <a class="linkem" href="https://www.jasonfujita.com/" target="_blank">Jason Fujita</a>, Comes a cute, meaningful, tear-jerker about a young fish just trying his best to make a good ramen dish.<br><br>Aki offered a few challenged when it came to dialogue editing, since some actors were recorded by myself in a studio, while others sent in recordings from remote home studios, often varying in quality. In the end, I was able to work through the recording differences to produce a seamless dialogue-driven story.<br><br>Aki was one of a handful of student films selected to be screened at the 2022 CalArts Character Animation Producers' Show.
