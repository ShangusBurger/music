			<h1>The Telephone Project</a></h1>
			<p class="pageText"> I created this project in the summer of 2019 in an effort to give myself and other artists inspiration to
			create something new.<br><br>The idea was that each creator would take what was sent to them as inspiration for a work of their own, which they would then pass on to the next artist.
			It began with a painting I made over the course of a few days and sent to a musician friend, and from there, a few more people have added their work.<br><br>
			While the process is slow in its nature, the result is an evolving lineage of creativity and thought.
