			<h1>2022 World Music Festival</h1>
			<p class="pageText">CalArts hosts an annual event showcasing members of the World Music Department called the World Music Festival. Often one of the most popular events of the year, people come from all over to hear and see music and dance from Ghana, Bali, Japan, Brazil, and many other parts of the world. 2022 was the first festival back from the hiatus caused by the pandemic, and was an energy-filled and lively performance. <br><br>The section of the festival I was involved with was the "African Muisc and Dance Ensemble", in which we performed music from the Ewe, Dagarti, and Lobi people of West Africa. Personal highlights include dancing a piece called Adzohu at 23:00, and playing the traditional Lobi xylophone, the Gyil, in a piece called Bawa at around 58:15.</p>
