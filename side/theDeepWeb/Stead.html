			<h1>Stead</h1>
			<p class="pageText">
				Stead is an original found-footage film exploring topics like suburbia, family, and marriage. The sound for the film was created from scratch before any work was done on the picture, which made for a fun and unique creative project. <br><br>Stead was one of my first experiments with more experimental sound for film, and one of the first live action films I have been a part of producing. The film premiered at my Graduation Recital: <a class="linkem" href="./HojPoj.html">Hoj Poj</a>.<br><br>All footage used was taken from the <a class="linkem" href="https://archive.org/details/prelinger">Prelinger Archive of Home Movies</a>.
