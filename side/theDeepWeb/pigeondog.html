			<h1><a class="linkem">pigeon.dog</a></h1>
			<p class="pageText"><a class="linkem">pigeon.dog</a>, for the first few months of its existence, was known as the Post-Quarentine Bucket List.
			It was essentially a google doc upon which a few friends and I would apply our 2am stream of conciousness to help deal with the pandemic.<br><br>
			The smartest and most tech savvy of my friends, <a class="linkem" href="https://github.com/banditsbeware" target="_blank">David Rademacher</a>, had the brilliant idea of turning this document into a website,
			so that we could practice our coding, add some features that a google document wouldn't allow, and share it with the world.<br><br>
			It is a constantly growing playground of odd, extraordinarily detailed messages and activities that I constantly get lost in.
