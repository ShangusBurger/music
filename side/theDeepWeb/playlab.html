			<h1>PLAYLAB 2020</a></h1>
			<p class="pageText"> Playlab is a winter session class at CalArts, in which students from multiple schools meet for 2 weeks and create a performance from scratch.
			Two weeks is not very much time to create an entire performance, but somehow we put together something amazing.<br><br>
			There's a bit of mystery around the performance so I won't spoil anything, but with the help of some amazing dancers, graphic designers, musicians, and other creatives,
			I coded together a webpage to present our performance (and also played a bit of trumpet).
