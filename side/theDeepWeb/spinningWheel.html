			<h1>Spinning Wheel</h1>
			<p class="pageText">Spinning Wheel, by Blood, Sweat, and Tears holds a very special place in my heart.
				It was one of the first songs I can distinctly remember my father showing me as a kid, and is probably part of the reason I started playing the trumpet.<br><br>
				To say Merry Christmas and thank him for being so incredible, I did my best to create my own version of Spinning wheel for my dad.<br><br>
				The entire thing was created alone in my bedroom, which made for some interesting replacements to some iconic parts, but I like to think the personal touch is what makes the cover special.
