			<h1>Medium (Work in Progress)</h1>
			<p class="pageText">
				Medium is a solo endeavor into Unity, Wwise, C#, and sound/music for video games. One major problem I faced the past few years is that I had a desire to work on sound for video games, but no idea where to find someone working on a game and in need of a person like me, with no experience or portfolio. So, I chose instead to create my own "game", or what I like to call a virtual installation, to both practice this medium ;) and explore what artmaking in 3D space is like without needing access to a real space for building an installation. <br><br>
				As it turns out, virtual space opens up sound art way past what a simple installation does, because the virutal world isn't confined to the same rules as the physical world.
