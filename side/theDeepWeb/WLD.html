			<h1>Weird Looking Dogs</h1>
			<p class="pageText">
				Co-directed by the amazing <a class="linkem" href="https://www.instagram.com/young_kanvas/?hl=en" target="_blank">Young Kang</a> and <a class="linkem" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06Yh0gGJspxyLEMJ61GP1g" target="_blank">Anya Butler</a>, with music by the stupendous <a class="linkem" href="https://www.royberardo.com/index.php" target="_blank">Roy Berardo</a>, Weird Looking Dogs follows the story of two friends catching up while exploring a dungeon, coming across a few adventurous monsters on their way. <br><br>With 10:22 of action-packed scenes, this project was a lot to take on as a solo sound designer, foley artist, and mixer, especially because of its lively cartoony feeling with which I have less experience. But, it has become a project which I am extremely proud of, and will go down as one of the hardest projects I completed in my collegiate years. It also holds a special place in my heart because I got to create the voice of some of the most essential characters to the story, the monsters themselves.
