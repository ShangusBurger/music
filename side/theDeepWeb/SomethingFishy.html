			<h1>Something Fishy</h1>
			<p class="pageText">
				In collaboration with the incredible filmmaker <a class="linkem" href="https://www.instagram.com/christinawoowoo/" target="_blank">Christina Woo</a>, and with music from the lovely Emily Tschirhart, Something Fishy tells the story of Sara, a woman getting ready to go on a date with her new boyfriend. But Jessica, Sara's pet goldfish, notices something not quite right about him. <br><br>Something Fishy was a challenge in subtlety. There is only so much sound in an LA apartment, so creativity within the realm of noise had to be explored in other ways, like playing with reverb very intentionally, or making music convincingly diegetic. As always, working with Christina was an amazing treat. <br><br>Something Fishy was one of a handful of student films selected to be screened at the 2022 CalArts Character Animation Producers' Show.
