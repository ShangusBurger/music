			<p class="pageText">'is this music?' is an exploration into the definition of music. It's structured so that the beginning is a sound that most people would consider music,
				a boring solo trumpet line with pitches and rhythm and all that good stuff. Slowly as the line evolves, it loses some characteristics that make it so 'musical,' like
				diatonicism, pitch center, normal rhythm, a sense of time, trumpet timbre, you get the point.<br><br>
				In my eyes, this is less of a piece of music and more of an philisophical journey. I wanted to create a gradient from music to not music, and ask where on that gradient do we draw a line,
				or possibly a more important question: Do we have to draw a line at all?
