			<h1>Hoj Poj</h1>
			<p class="pageText">Hoj Poj: Shane Vincent's Performer-Composer Grad Recital, is the culmination of two years studying at CalArts, and includes an ecclectic collection of original art, traditional music, and performance. The whole thing would not have been possible without the dozens of performers, teachers, and technical staff at CalArts. <br><br> The first piece on the concert is an original piece for trumpet and electronics called <a class="linkem" href="/side/theDeepWeb/Anthrum.html" target="_blank">Anthrum</a>, followed by a duet for the Lobi xylopone called the Gyil, performed alongside CalArts alum Kevin O'Sullivan. Afterward was the premiere screening of <a class="linkem" href="/side/theDeepWeb/Stead.html" target="_blank">Stead</a>, an original found-footage film with original sound. The second half of the concert included renditions of Earth, Wind, and Fire's After the Love is Gone and Silk Sonic's Skate, and a closing piece performed by members of the CalArts African Ensemble called Atsia, a traditional Ewe dance.</p>
