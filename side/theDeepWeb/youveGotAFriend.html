			<h1>You've Got A Friend</h1>
			<p class="pageText">My mother was never a practicing musician, but always had a deep appreceation for music. When I told her I wanted to study music,
				she was nothing but excitedly supportive that I was doing something I was passionate about. She always wants to hear what I have to make, so as a gift,
				I recreated her favorite song from her youth.<br><br>
				Learning guitar was well worth seeing the joy on her face when she first listened to it.
