				Led by the incredible salsa musicians and faculty David Roitstein and Joey De Leon, the CalArts Salsa band has a reputation for playing music that gets people up and dancing. Although the Fall of 2021 was spent online, making salsa dance parties impossible, one silver lining was that the group was able to remotely record a half dozen tunes together, all of which were arranged for the group by its members. Yerbero Moderno, which you can listen to here, is the arrangement I produced for the band. <br><br> Luckily, the Salsa band was able to perform in person in the Spring of 2022, and performed at LatinFest, Noon Concerts, and Graduation gatherings for hundreds of dancers excited to be back listening to live Salsa music.
