			<p class="bioPrph"> &emsp;&emsp;Hi! I'm Shane Vincent, a sound artist, trumpeter, composer, and recent graduate in performance and composition from <a class="linkem" href="https://calarts.edu/" target="_blank">CalArts</a> in Santa Clarita, CA. My original works include sound art, foley art and sound design for film, pieces for solo instruments and small ensembles in a variety of styles and instrumentations, and music and sound for video games. When it comes to performing, I've had the pleasure of performing in ensembles like the <a class="linkem" href="../side/theDeepWeb/Salsa.html">CalArts Salsa Band</a> and the <a class="linkem" href="https://musicdancetheatre.asu.edu/ensembles/wind-symphony" target="_blank">ASU Wind Symphony</a>. Beyond concert trumpet, I've experienced a diverse musical history, from my time at the <a class="linkem" href="https://bluedevils.org/" target="_blank">Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps</a>, a world class marching music ensemble, to playing with the <a class="linkem" href="../side/theDeepWeb/WMF.html">CalArts African Ensemble</a>, a group that performs music from multiple language groups in Ghana, I love to pull from my broad range of experiences.<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;While audio is the most dominant influence in my life, I love exploring other fields related to arts and science. I've written and performed for <a class="linkem" href="http://www.asucomedy.com/farce-side-comedy-hour.html" target="_blank">Farce Side Comedy Hour</a>, a weekly sketch comedy show. I've studied and performed modern dance and ballet for a graduate thesis. I enjoy dabbling in microelectronics like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and coding has always been something I revisit and explore. I like to think that all of these experiences influence and inform my audio work.<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;I was raised in Tucson, Arizona by two amazing parents. When I'm not making music, you can catch me dancing, playing chess, bouldering, and spending time with friends online.
