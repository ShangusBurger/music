			<p style="width: 60%; float: left; margin-top: 10%; line-height: 28px;"> &emsp;&emsp;Hi! I'm Shane, a composer, trumpeter, and audio engineer currently studying Performance-Composition at <a class="linkem" href="https://calarts.edu/">CalArts</a> in Santa Clarita, CA. I like to think my compositions spread across multiple genres and instrumentations, and include variety the likes of film scores, solo pieces, orchestral pieces, and avant garde sound art. On the trumpet, I have the most experience with classical and jazz music, having held principal and lead roles in ensembles like the <a class="linkem" href="https://musicdancetheatre.asu.edu/ensembles/wind-symphony">ASU Wind Symphony</a>. I'm working on expanding my stylistic ability, and am currently exploring mariachi, serial, and commercial music.<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;While music is the most dominant influence in my life, I has a plethora of experience in other fields. From my time at the <a class="linkem" href="https://bluedevils.org/">Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps</a>, a world class marching music ensemble, to my lead performance in the musical 9 to 5, to my membership with <a class="linkem" href="http://www.asucomedy.com/farce-side-comedy-hour.html">Farce Side Comedy Hour</a>, a weekly sketch comedy show at Arizona State University, to narrating and editing Bloomington Boys: Casper, an audiobook available on Audible, I've pooled my skills from my diverse past experiences into all my current creative endeavors.<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;I was raised in Tucson, Arizona, and began my higher education at Arizona State University, studying Music Education. While I still love teaching, especially in the marching arts, I decided to move to Santa Clarita to study Composition and Performance. When I'm not making music, I love to dance, play chess, boulder, and spend time with friends online.
