			<p style="width: 60%; float: left; margin-top: 10%; line-height: 28px;"> &emsp;&emsp;Hi! I'm Shane Vincent, a composer, trumpeter, and sound designer currently studying performance and composition at <a class="linkem" href="https://calarts.edu/" target="_blank">CalArts</a> in Santa Clarita, CA. My compositions spread across multiple genres and instrumentations, including film scores, solo pieces, orchestral pieces, and avant garde sound art. My trumpet experience is mainly with classical and jazz music, having held principal roles in ensembles like the <a class="linkem" href="https://musicdancetheatre.asu.edu/ensembles/wind-symphony" target="_blank">ASU Wind Symphony</a>, or <a class="linkem" href="https://music.calarts.edu/ensembles" target="_blank">The Ensemble</a> at CalArts, a group that specializes in contemporary instrumental music. That said, my musical endeavors aren't confined to just concert music. From my time at the <a class="linkem" href="https://bluedevils.org/" target="_blank">Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps</a>, a world class marching music ensemble, to my lead performance in the musical 9 to 5, to my attempts at electronic music production, I wear a lot of different musical hats.<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;While music is the most dominant influence in my life, I have a plethora of experience in other fields. I've written and performed for <a class="linkem" href="http://www.asucomedy.com/farce-side-comedy-hour.html" target="_blank">Farce Side Comedy Hour</a>, a weekly sketch comedy show. I've narrated and edited Bloomington Boys: Casper, an audiobook available on Audible. I've studied and performed modern dance and ballet. I pool my skills from these diverse past experiences into all my current creative projects.<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;I was raised in Tucson, Arizona by two amazing parents. When I'm not making music, you can catch me dancing, playing chess, bouldering, and spending time with friends online.
